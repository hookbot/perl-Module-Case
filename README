======

This module was created to alleviate the problems caused by
case-insensitive operating systems or file systems such as
Windows or OSX when attempting to load a module that doesn't
exactly match the case.
This is especially troublesome when there are two different
modules within the @INC that are case-insensitively similar.
Using this module can force a module to load ONLY if the case
matches exactly just as if the file system containing the
module were case-sensitive.
