This module was created to alleviate the problems caused by
case-ignorant or case-insensitive file systems or operating
systems such as Windows or OSX when attempting to load a
module that doesn't exactly match the case.

This is especially troublesome when there are two different
modules within the @INC that are case-insensitively similar.
It becomes very difficult to load the one that comes later in
the @INC because it will always get snagged on the first one.

Using this module can force a module to load ONLY if the case
matches exactly, just as if the file system containing the
module were case-sensitive.

Module::Case is efficient enough to run in production.
